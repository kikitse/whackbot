# What Whackbot does

Whackbot has two main functions:

1. A Sydney eatery finder

You can give Whackbot your suburb or postcode and Whackbot will tell you some of the best eateries in that suburb or postcode!

I made this because my friend has a million suggestions of where to eat in Sydney so I made this so I can walk around Sydney and open up slack and find where to eat in my current suburb!

2. Insult-bot

Whackbot will provide the best insults to insult your friends! You can get Shakespearen or Pirate insults to insult your friends!

I made this because my friend and I insult each other a lot. I made this so I can finally get one up on her with no effort (except for the coding effort).

# Whackbot Commands

1. A Sydney eatery finder

Type this text:

"What to eat in 2000"

or

"What to eat in Surry Hills"

The suburb capitalisation and spelling must be accurate to find the correct results.

2. Insult-bot

Type this text:

"Insult me Shakespeare"

or

"Insult me Pirate"

The "Shakespeare" and "Pirate" words much be spelt and capitalised to return the correct results.
